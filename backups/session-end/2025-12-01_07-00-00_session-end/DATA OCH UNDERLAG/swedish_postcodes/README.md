# Swedish postcodes and their coordinates


This data is a list of address coordinates along with the address postcode. The data has been extracted from the dataset [Belägenhetsadress Nedladdning, vektor](https://geotorget.lantmateriet.se/geodataprodukter/belagenhetsadress-nedladdning-vektor-api) from the APIs of the Swedish mapping, cadastral and land registration authority (*Lantmäteriet).
All other metadata has been removed. If you reuse it, you need to mention that it comes from Lantmäteriet, to comply with the original license (CC-BY 4.0).

Thanks to the EU High Value Datasets directive and despite the resistance of Swedish government agencies, this data is now available free of charge, albeit with a few hurdles.
It can hopefully lead to the end of the monopoly of [Postnummerservice Norden AB](https://postnummerservice.se). Postnord gave exclusive rights to sell postcode data to this private company back in 2005.

This dataset is in no way meant to replace the extensive set of APIs offered by Postnummerservice today. It is merely a sneak peek at what can be found in the data freely available since last week.
